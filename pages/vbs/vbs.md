Jambo! Welcome to TCAC's annual summer VBS. This year, we'll go on an exciting expedition through the book of Proverbs, which is full of wisdom that God has shared with us. From Proverbs, we'll learn how to make wise choices in our lives.

We set off on Saturday with a skit and songs to praise God. Throughout the day, we'll listen to stories, make crafts, and play games, with breaks for lunch and snacks. Finally, we'll gather and talk about what we've learned before going home to get rested.

On Sunday, we'll get to sing the songs and review the lessons we learned the day before. That leaves us with just enough time for one final lesson and a delicious lunch, before we conclude our journey at Camp Kilimanjaro.

We're sure you'll learn a lot while also having fun, so we really hope you can make it! Don't wait; [sign up today]({{ site.data.misc.vbsreg }}){:target="_blank"}!
